/**
 * use cases of singleton: -
 *
 * For resources that are expensive to create (like database connection objects)
 * It's good practice to keep all loggers as Singletons which increases performance
 * Classes which provide access to configuration settings for the application
 * Classes that contain resources that are accessed in shared mode
 *
 * The singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. Sometimes we need to have only one instance
 * of our class for example a single DB connection shared by multiple objects as creating a separate DB
 * connection for every object may be costly. Similarly, there can be a single configuration manager or error
 * manager in an application that handles all problems instead of creating multiple managers.
 *
 * Definition:
 * The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
 * Letâ€™s see various design options for implementing such a class. If you have a good handle on static
 * class variables and access modifiers this should not be a difficult task.
